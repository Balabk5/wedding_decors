            Weddings are significant events in peopleâ€™s lives and as such,
            couples are often willing to spend considerable amount of money to
            ensure that their weddings are well-organized. Wedding planners are
            often used by couples who work long hours and have little spare time
            available for sourcing and managing wedding venues.
